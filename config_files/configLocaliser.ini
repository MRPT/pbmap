# This config file sets the thresholds for the geometric and radiometric constraints of 
# the interpretation tree, which is used to find previous places (e.g. for relocalization 
# or loop closure detection). 
# This file is read by the header heuristicParams.h, and is used by the class PbMapLocaliser.
